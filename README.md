## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I think most important think I learned is to code the Frontend following web design that has been provided, it more efficient. If coding Frontend without design (Figma or eq) first it takes more time to IMAGINE, TESTING, and FIX. But with design first, the IMAGINE in the designing part, and coding Frontend would be smoother with less testing. Of course if there is no Error syntax or Logic :V.

### Useful resources
